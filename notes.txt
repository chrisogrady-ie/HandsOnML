What is the big picture of the project?
What is the goal acquired from this project
Get the data
Explore the data to gain insights
Frame the data
    - supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
    - classification, regression
    - batch learning, online learning
List assumptions
Prepare the data to expose underlying patterns(ML)
Explore many different models
Fine tune models to turn them into a better solution
Present the solution

m = instances of RMSE(Root Mean Square Error)
x(i) = occurrence of all the feature values at (i)
y(i) = desired output for that instance
try for a bell shaped curve through transformations for better ML algorithms
